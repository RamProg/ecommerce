# Welcome to Cosmic E-Commerce!

Hi! My name is Ramiro and this is a project done in React for CoderHouse.

## What is this?

This is a basic ecommerce app currently in development

## What is it about?

I got a little ahead of times and thought about an ecommerce to sell spaceships and accesories like dragon ball stickers.

## How does it work?

This an SPA (Single Page Application) that allows to navigate through different categories and products and them to your cart.

## Is this a real business?

**No**, unfortunately I don't currently own any spaceships and therefore I can't sell them.

## Should I invest in this?

Sure, you can hire me as a developer and hopefully when spaceships are in the market we will the firsts in getting into it.

## How can I run the app?

You can visit https://coderhouse-ecommerce.herokuapp.com/ or you can clone this repo with:

    git clone https://github.com/RamProg/ecommerce

 And then you need to install the dependencies with:

    npm i

Finally, you need to start it with:

    npm start

## Comments

So far this project in focused on logic and usability, the aesthetics and design are not a priority right now. So you might find it ugly, but the plan is to work on that once everything else is finished. I focused on complying with every requisit, even the extra requisites from the Coder House course.

## Dependencies

On top o the dependencies worked on the Coder House course, I used "@react-firebase/auth": "^0.2.10"

https://react-firebase-js.com/docs/react-firebase-auth/getting-started

I used this dependency to manage firebase user sessions.
